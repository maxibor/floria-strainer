# floria-strainer

Given the output of the Strain Haplotyping software [floria](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/floria)[^1] , **floria-strainer** computes the allele frequency at each variable position for each haploset identified by floria to cluster them into the different mixtures of strains using a Gaussian Mixture Model.
